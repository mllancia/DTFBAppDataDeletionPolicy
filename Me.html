        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Freddie.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m from the US and have been traveling in Europe (Italy, Denmark, UK, Germany, The Balkans, France, Turkey&#8230;) and Australia for about 5 years now.</p>
        <p>I financed my life by working as a data scientist for sustainable start ups.

                See what I've been up to.

        </p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m interested in people and what makes them them. I&rsquo;m interested in breaking stereotypes as well as finding the truth in them.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m interested in individual experiences and instances rather than theories and generalizations.</p>

        <p>I believe in openness to and manifesting good things. That what we believe in is much more likely to become true. At least, it is more likely that we will perceive it that way.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m interested in trying to express myself and helping others to do the same.</p>

        <p>

                Link back home to see how I&rsquo;m doing that.
